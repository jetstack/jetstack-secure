# GKE Data Gatherer

The GKE *data gatherer* fetches information about a cluster from the Google
Kubernetes Engine API.

## Data

The output of the GKE data gatherer follows the format described in the
[GKE API reference](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.clusters#Cluster)
and the [Go Docs](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/container/v1#Cluster).

It's comparable to the output from:

```bash
gcloud container clusters describe my-cluster --format=json
```

## Configuration

To use the GKE data gatherer add a `gke` entry to the `data-gatherers`
configuration. For example:

```
data-gatherers:
- kind: "gke"
  name: "gke"
  config:
  # Path to a file containing the credentials. If empty, it will try to use
  # the SDK defaults (explained below)
  # credentials-path: /tmp/credentials.json
    cluster:
      project: my-gcp-project
      location: us-central1-a
      name: my-gke-cluster
```

The `gke` configuration contains the following fields:

- `credentials-path`: *optional* The path to a file containing credentials for
  your cluster.
- `cluster`
  - `name`: The name of your GKE cluster.
  - `project`: The ID of your Google Cloud Platform project.
  - `location`: The compute zone or region where your cluster is running.

## Permissions

If a `credentials-path` file is not specified, Preflight will attempt to use
Application Default Credentials or the metadata API (as per Google SDK default).

If Preflight is running locally and the `gcloud` command is installed and
configured, just run `gcloud auth application-default login` to set up
Application Default Credentials.

The `credentials` file path is useful if you want to configure a separate
service account for Preflight to use to fetch GKE data.

The user and service account must have the correct [IAM
Roles](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/iam).
Specifically it must have the `container.clusters.get` permission. This can be
given with the _Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer_ role
(`roles/container.clusterViewer`).

### Sample Terraform Configuration

This can be used to create a GCP service account called `preflight` which is
then bound to a custom role of the same name with the minimum required
permissions.


```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = "~> 0.12"
}

variable "project_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The ID of the project where the cluster Preflight is going to check is."
}

# https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html
provider "google" {
  version = "2.5.1"
  project = var.project_id
}

# https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/google_service_account.html
resource "google_service_account" "preflight_agent_service_account" {
  project = var.project_id
  account_id   = "preflight-agent"
  display_name = "Service account for Preflight Agent"
}

# https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/google_project_iam_custom_role.html
resource "google_project_iam_member" "preflight_agent_cluster_viewer" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/container.clusterViewer" # allows getting of credentials, all other permissions handled in k8s RBAC
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.preflight_agent_service_account.email}"
}

# if using workload identity in GKE, use the following binding to allow the
# agent to use the service account
resource "google_project_iam_binding" "preflight_agent_workload_identity" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser"
  members = "serviceAccount:${var.project_id}.svc.id.goog[preflight/default]"
}
```
