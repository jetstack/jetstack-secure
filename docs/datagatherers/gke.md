# GKE Data Gatherer

The GKE *data gatherer* fetches information about a cluster 
from the Google Kubernetes Engine API.

## Data

The output of the GKE data gatherer follows the format described in the
[GKE API reference](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.clusters#Cluster)
and the [Go Docs](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/container/v1#Cluster).
These are useful to check when writing new rules.

The gathered data looks like this:

```json
{
  "Cluster": {...}
}
```

## Configuration

To use the GKE *data gatherer* add a `gke` section to the 
`data-gatherers` configuration. 
For example:

```
...
data-gatherers:
  gke:
    project: my-gcp-project
    location: us-central1-a
    cluster: my-gke-cluster
    # Path to a file containing the credentials. If empty, it will try to use Workload Identity (run `gcloud auth application-default login`).
    # credentials: /tmp/credentials.json
...
```

The `gke` configuration contains the following fields:

- `project`: The ID of your Google Cloud Platform project.
- `location`: The compute zone or region where your cluster is running.
- `cluster`: The name of your GKE cluster.
- `credentials`: *optional* The path to a file containing credentials for your cluster.
  
An example configuration can be found at
[`./examples/gke.preflight.yaml`](./examples/gke.preflight.yaml).

## Permissions

If a `credentials` file is not specified,
Preflight will attempt to use Workload Identity or Application Default Credentials.

If Preflight is running locally
and the `gcloud` command is installed and configured,
just run `gcloud auth application-default login` to set up
Application Default Credentials.

The `credentials` file is useful if you want to configure
a separate service account for Preflight to use to fetch GKE data.

Whatever user or service account is used must have the correct
[IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/iam).
Specifically it must have the `container.clusters.get` permission.
This can be given with the _Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer_ role
(`roles/container.clusterViewer`).

A sample Terraform project can be found at
[`./deployment/terraform/gke-datagatherer/`](deployment/terraform/gke-datagatherer).
This can be used to create a GCP service account called `preflight` which
is then bound to a custom role of the same name
with the minimum required permissions.
