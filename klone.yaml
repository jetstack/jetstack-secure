# This klone.yaml file describes the Makefile modules and versions that are
# cloned into the "make/_shared" folder. These modules are dynamically imported
# by the root Makefile. The "make upgrade-klone" target can be used to pull
# the latest version from the upstream repositories (using the repo_ref value).
#
# More info can be found here: https://github.com/cert-manager/makefile-modules
