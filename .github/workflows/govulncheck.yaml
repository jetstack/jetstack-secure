# This file is separated from the upstream file so we can add additional auth for pulling
# private dependencies. Govulncheck doesn't seem to be able to support skipping private
# dependencies.

# Run govulncheck at midnight every night on the main branch,
# to alert us to recent vulnerabilities which affect the Go code in this
# project.
