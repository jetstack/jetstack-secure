Package suggestions are ideas for new Preflight packages or package rules.
If ever you encounter any configuration, option, etc. that could cause problems for customers,
or are aware of a best practise or feature to avoid please suggest it here.

**Package Name**

For example GKE, AKS, Istio, RBAC, Pods, etc.
This could be an existing package or a package that doesn't exist yet.
If this suggestion is just one rule please specify the package it should belong to.

**Package Rule(s)**

The rule or rules you are suggesting.
Ideally suggestions should include as much detail as possible with links for more information.

Please label this issue with `package` and `package/[PACKAGE_NAME]`.
For example `package/gke`.
If no label exists for this suggestion's package name please create one.
